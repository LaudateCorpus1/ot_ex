defmodule OT.Text.Composition do
  @moduledoc """
  The composition of two non-concurrent operations into a single operation.

  @doc """
  Compose two operations into a single equivalent operation.

  The operations are composed in such a way that the resulting operation has the
  same effect on document state as applying one operation and then the other:
  *S ○ compose(Oa, Ob) = S ○ Oa ○ Ob*.

  ## Example

      iex> OT.Text.Composition.compose(["Bar"], [3])
      {:ok, ["Bar"]}
